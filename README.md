# UNIX-file-system
In this project, you will implement a simple UNIX-like file system with a hierarchical directory structure.
Files grow and directories grow and shrink, so you need to manage free disk space. You will
be able to browse the directory structure, create new files and directories, delete them, etc. The
functionality is similar to UNIX file systems, but it does not include permission and user management.
Neither do we require concurrency or high performance from your file system. In other words, you can
assume it is accessed only by one process at a time.
